# Testing examples using Spring  
This is a step by tep guide to testing Spring application, starting from Spring 4 to Spring Boot. Beginning from old Spring Framework with JUnit 4, the project progresses slowly to Spring Boot Project with JUnit 5, and adding extra features along the way. Each of the steps are shown in different branches, final project being on the main branch. 

This example is from Catalin Tudose's "JUnit in Actions". I've adopted his code into Java 17 and the latest Spring Boot versions.
